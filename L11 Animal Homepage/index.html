            The rescue effort requires able bodied individuals who have desires to help the environment. Any efforts,
            big or small, are not only adequate, but encouraged. We at the Indigenous Animals Rescue Service firmly
            believe that every effort is its own reward and that together, we can make a world of difference!

          <h2>Animal Care</h2>
          <p>Here at the Indigenous Animals Rescue Service, our goal is to keep the wildlife wild. While our expert
            animal health specialists take excellent care of the animals, we do what we can to avoid domestication. In
            doing so, we ensure the best chance for survival when the animals are returned to their homes when it is
            safe to do so. </p>

          <p>
            Success is measured in our best efforts, but also in ensuring that every animal that comes into our care
            is properly cared for. We aim to be able to care for 100% of all animals brought to our care. We also
            determine success to be measured by community involvement in our rescue efforts.

          <p>We need you! While our organization spans the entirety of the Australian countryside, we are made up
            entirely of determined volunteers. Without your help we aren't able to do anything! Whether that help is
            small in scale, the difference could be lifechanging for another. Be the difference you want to see in
            this world, join the cause today!</p>
